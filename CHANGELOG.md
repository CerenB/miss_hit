# MISS_HIT Release Notes

## 0.9.5-dev

* Disabled (but not removed) the `implicit_shortcircuit` rule. It
  turns out that in some cases `&` really does mean `&`, even inside
  an if guard. Curiously, mlint/checkcode shares this bug. To properly
  resolve this we need semantic analysis and type inference; so until
  then this rule just does nothing.

* MH Metric can now process and produce metrics for code inside modern
  SIMULINK models (slx files). This does not work yet in MH Style, but
  I plan to also support this there.

### Known issues

#### Tooling

* #123 [formatting not always idempotent](https://github.com/florianschanda/miss_hit/issues/123)

#### Language support

None known. Should be compatible with up to MATLAB 2019b.

## 0.9.4

### Features
* MH Style has a new (autofixed) rule `no_starting_newline` to make
  sure files do not start with just whitespace.

* MH Style has a new (autofixed) rule `implicit_shortcircuit` that
  complains about misleading use of `&` and `|` inside if/while
  guards.

* The MH tools now allow all possible class method names, even the
  ones that are highly questionable like "import", "end", or
  "arguments".

### Fixes
* #131 The parser now allows the end of statement (newline, comma, or
  semicolon) after an enumeration keyword to be optional. I.e. we can
  now process this code fragment correctly:

  ```
  enumeration Picasso, Laura, King_Edward
  end
  ```

## 0.9.3

### Features
* MH Metric can now measure cyclomatic complexity. We've aimed for
  producing the same numbers as mlint does, even if it's wrong.

* MH Metric produces an (optional) table of "worst offenders" for each
  metric. This can be used to get a quick overview of code smell.

### Fixes
* Fix for #133: resolved multi-threading issues on Windows. To be
  honest, this seems more like a Python bug.

## 0.9.2

### Fixes
* Workaround for #133. Until I can work what the root cause of this
  is, multi-threading is disabled on Windows platforms.

## 0.9.1

This is the first "release", previously it was all just one
development stream. This release contains two tools:

* mh_style.py: a fully functional style checker and code formatter for
  MATLAB.

* mh_metric.py: a mostly functional code metrics tool for MATLAB. Some
  metric (in particular cyclomatic complexity) are not measured yet.
