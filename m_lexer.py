# The 1999 technical report "The Design and Implementation of a Parser
# and Scanner for the MATLAB Language in the MATCH Compiler" is a key
# piece of work that this lexer is based on. You can find a copy at:
#
# http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/cpdc/pjoisha/MAGICA/CPDC-TR-9909-017.pdf

#
# TODO: This lexer does not yet implement all the fine details. In
# particular the matrix processing is definitely wrong. But it's good
# enough to get started.
#

#
# Q: Why no PLY based lexer?
#
# A: Well, the single quote character fucks up everything. The kind of
# tricks the technical report above employes cannot be reasonably used
# in PLY. How to do this well is an open question.
