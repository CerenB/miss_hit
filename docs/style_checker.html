  <header>MISS_HIT Style Checker</header>

  <main>
    <div class="section">
      MISS_HIT includes a simple style checker
      (<span class="file">mh_style.py</span>). It can detect and
      correct (when the --fix options given) a number of coding style
      issues, most of which are configurable.
    </div>
    <div class="title">
      <img src="assets/settings.svg" alt="Configuration" />
      <h1>Configuration</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Files</h2>
      <div>
        Options are read from configuration
        files <span class="file">miss_hit.cfg</span>. This behaviour can
        be disabled with the --ignore-config option. When analysing the
        file <span class="file">foo/bar/potato.m</span>, we will first
        look in the root for <span class="file">miss_hit.cfg</span>,
        then in <span class="file">foo/miss_hit.cfg</span>, and finally
        in <span class="file">foo/bar/miss_hit.cfg</span>. Each file
        augments or overwrites previously given configuration, and
        command-line options overwrite everything.
      </div>

      <div>
        For example you can put
        this <span class="file">miss_hit.cfg</span> in your project
        root:
      </div>

      <div>
        <pre>
# Options written like on the
# commandline
line_length: 100
file_length: 2500
copyright_entity: "Lord Buckethead"</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        And you can adjust options in subdirectories, for example if you place
        this in <span class="file">foo/miss_hit.cfg</span>:
      </div>

      <div>
        <pre>
# Legacy code which had a different
# coding standard
line_length: 180</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Then files in <span class="file">foo/</span> or below will be
        checked for a line length of 180 (redefined) and a file length
        of 2500 (taken over from the project root).
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Excluding directories from analysis</h2>
      <div>
        A special entry "enable" into
        a <span class="file">miss_hit.cfg</span> can be used to enable
        or disable analysis for the subtree.
      </div>

      <div>
        For example if you have a lot of legacy code you can put this
        into your root configuration:
      </div>

      <div>
        <pre>
enable: 0
line_length: 100</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        And then enable analysis for some subdirectories, e.g. in
        <span class="file">foo/new_code/miss_hit.cfg</span> you can
        write:
      </div>

      <div>
        <pre>
enable: 1</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Like any other option, the "closest one" takes precedence.
      </div>

      <div>
        You can also specify the special "exclude_dir" property in
        configuration files. This property must name a directory
        directly inside (i.e. you can't
        specify <span class="file">foo/bar</span>) the same directory
        the configuration file resides in. This is especially useful
        when including an external repository, over which we have
        limited control.
      </div>

      <div>
        Below is given a more realistic root configuration:
      </div>

      <div>
        <pre>
file_length: 1000
line_length: 120
copyright_entity: "Potato Inc."

# We include the delightful
# miss_hit tools in our repo,
# but don't want to accidentally
# check their weird test cases
exclude_dir: "miss_hit"</pre>
      </div>
    </section>

    <div class="title">
      <img src="assets/check-square.svg" alt="Justifications" />
      <h1>Justifications</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <div>
        Style issues can be justified by placing "mh:ignore_style" into
        a comment or line continuation. The justification applies to all
        style issues on that line.
      </div>

      <div>
        <pre>
% we normally get a message
% about no whitespace
% surrounding the =
x=5; % mh:ignore_style
        </pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Justifications that are useless generate a warning.
      </div>
    </section>

    <div class="title">
      <img src="assets/edit.svg" alt="Style Rules" />
      <h1>Style Rules</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <div>
        There are three types of rules:
      </div>

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Mandatory rules</b>: they are always active and can be
            automatically fixed
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Autofix rules</b>: they are optional and can be
            automatically fixed
          </li>
          <li><b>Rules</b>: they are optional and cannot be
            automatically fixed
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        Rules with a name (for example "whitespace_keywords") can be
        individually suppressed in or re-enabled in configuration files. For
        example:
      </div>

      <div>
        <pre>
suppress_rule: "builtin_shadow"
enable_rule: "file_length"
        </pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        By default all rules are active.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mandatory rules</h2>
      <div>
        These rules are always active. The technical reason for this is
        that it would be too difficult to autofix issues without
        autofixing these. If you pay me an excessive amount of money I
        could look into this but I'd rather keep the lexer vaguely
        sane. All of them are automatically fixed
        by <span class="file">mh_style.py</span> when the --fix option
        is specified.
      </div>

      <!-- HOOK: MANDATORY RULES -->
      <h4>Trailing newlines at end of file</h4>
      <div>
        This mandatory rule makes sure there is a single trailing newline
        at the end of a file.
      </div>

      <h4>Consecutive blank lines</h4>
      <div>
        This rule allows a maximum of one blank line to separate code blocks.
        Comments are not considered blank lines.
      </div>

      <h4>Use of tab</h4>
      <div>
        This rule enforces the absence of the tabulation character
        *everywhere*. When auto-fixing, a tab-width of 4 is used by default,
        but this can be configured with the options `tab_width`.
      </div>

      <div>
        Note that the fix replaces the tab everywhere, including in strings
        literals. This means
      </div>

      <div>
        <pre>
&quot;a&lt;tab&gt;b&quot;
   &quot;a&lt;tab&gt;b&quot;
        </pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        might be fixed to
      </div>

      <div>
        <pre>
&quot;a        b&quot;
   &quot;a     b&quot;
        </pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Which may or may not what you had intended originally. I am not sure
        if this is a bug or a feature, but either way it would be *painful* to
        change so I am going to leave this as is.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>tab_width</b>: Tab-width, by default 4.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Trailing whitespace</h4>
      <div>
        This rule enforces that there is no trailing whitespace in your files.
        You *really* want to do this, even if the MATLAB default editor makes
        this really hard. The reason is that it minimises conflicts when using
        modern version control systems.
      </div>

      <!-- END HOOK: MANDATORY RULES -->
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Autofix rules</h2>
      <div>
        The following rules are automatically fixed
        by <span class="file">mh_style.py</span> when the --fix option
        is specified.
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace surrounding commas ("whitespace_comma")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace after commas, and no whitespace
        before commas, e.g. `foo, bar, baz`.
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace surrounding colon ("whitespace_colon")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces no whitespace around colons, except after
        commas.
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace around assignment ("whitespace_assignment")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace around the assignment operation
        (=).
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace surrounding brackets ("whitespace_brackets")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace after square and round brackets,
        and no whitespace before their closing counterpart. For
        example: [foo, bar]
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace after some words ("whitespace_keywords")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure there is whitespace after some words such
        as "if" or "properties".
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace in comments ("whitespace_comments")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure there is some whitespace between the
        comment character (%) and the rest of the comment. The exception
        is "divisor" comments like "%%%%%%%%%%%%%%" and the pragmas such
        as "%#codegen".
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace in continuation ("whitespace_continuation")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure there is some whitespace between the last
        thing on a line and a line continuation.
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace around operators ("operator_whitespace")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure binary operators (except for the power
        operators) are surrounded by whitespace, and unary operators
        are not followed by whitespace. Like so:
      </div>

      <div>
        <pre>
x = -foo + bar;
y = x^2;
        </pre>
      </div>

      <!-- HOOK: AUTOFIX RULES -->
      <!-- END HOOK: AUTOFIX RULES -->
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <div>
        These rules cannot be auto-fixed because there is no "obvious"
        fix.
      </div>

      <h4>Copyright notice ("copyright_notice")</h4>

      <div>
        This rules looks for a copyright notice at the beginning of each
        file in the form of "(C) Copyright YEAR-YEAR ENTITY" or "(C)
        Copyright YEAR ENTITY". The list of acceptable entities can be
        configured with copyright_entity. This option can be given more
        than once to permit a set of valid copyright holders. If this
        options is not set, the rule just looks for any copyright
        notice.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>copyright_entity</b>: Can be specified more than
            once. Make sure each copyright notice mentions one of these.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Comma line endings ("eol_comma")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule complains about any line that ends in a comma. If you
        have a ; at the end of each statement it really helps you
        pretend that your using a real programming language, and so this
        rule is quite helpful for sanity.
      </div>

      <h4>Shadowing of built-in functions ("builtin_shadow")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule attempts to find cases where we assign to a MATLAB
        builtin function (e.g. re-defining false to be 1). Note: this
        rule does not catch all cases and raises false alarms because we
        don't have a working parser yet. Once we have a parser this can
        be done easily and correctly.
      </div>

      <!-- HOOK: RULES -->
      <h4>Maximum file length ("file_length")</h4>
      <div>
        This is configurable with `file_length`. It is a good idea to keep
        the length of your files under some limit since it forces your
        project into avoiding the worst spaghetti code.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>file_length</b>: Maximum lines in a file, 1000 by default.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Max characters per line ("line_length")</h4>
      <div>
        This is configurable with `line_length`, default is 80. It is a
        good idea for readability to avoid overly long lines. This can help
        you avoid extreme levels of nesting and avoids having to scroll
        around.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>line_length</b>: Maximum characters per line, 80 by default.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
