      The behaviour of the <a href="index.html">MISS_HIT</a> tools can
      be controlled with pragmas (special comments that can be placed
      in the source code). This document describes the syntax and
      semantics of the pragmas.

      <h2>Style justification</h2>
      <div>
        You can justify style issues by placing a style justification
        pragma on the same line the message occurs.
        <pre>% mh:ignore_style</pre>

      <h2>Parametric pragmas</h2>
      <div>
        There is an extended form of pragmas that can be extended in
        the future to also deal with other issues. The general syntax
        is:
        <pre>% mh:TOOL ACTION PARAMETER: REASON</pre>
        The TOOL, ACTION, and PARAMETER are documented below. REASON is a
        free-text explanation. It does not need to appear in quotes, the
        REASON is everything after the colon to the end of the line.
        Currently it is not possible to have a multi-line reason, but we
        plan to add this in a future release.
      </div>

      <div>
        These pragmas must appear on their own line, and they only apply
        to the level of scope where they appear.
      </div>

      <div>
        For example this is an appropriate metric justification, since
        it applies to the function it appear is.
<pre>
function foo
   % mh:metric justify npath: for testing purposes
   if foo
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        This metric justification no longer applies to the function
        foo since it does not appear in the top level of scope.
<pre>
function foo
   if foo
      % mh:metric justify npath: for testing purposes
</pre>
      </div>

      <h2>Metric justification</h2>
      <div>
        Metric violations can be justified using a parametric
        pragma. The TOOL is metric, the ACTION is justify and the
        PARAMETER is the name of the metric, as listed in the
        <a href="metrics.html">mh_metric manual</a>. For example:
        <pre>% mh:metric justify file_length: impossible to split up</pre>
