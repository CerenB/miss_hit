    <div class="section">
      <a href="index.html">MISS_HIT</a> includes a simple code metric
      tool (<span class="file">mh_metric.py</span>). It computes code
      metrics and (in a future release) complains if the metrics
      exceed acceptable levels.

      <h2>Using MISS_HIT Metric</h2>
      <div>
        This tool works exactly the same as the style checker, and
        re-uses the same <a href="style_checker.html">configuration
        files and mechanism</a>.
      </div>

      <div>
        To compute metrics on a single file:
        <pre>$ mh_metric.py my_file.m</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        To compute metrics for all files in a directory tree:
        <pre>$ mh_metric.py src/</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Currently, metrics are printed on standard out. In a future
        release other formats (HTML report, json, csv, etc.) will be
        supported.

      <h1>Metrics</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <h2>File metrics</h2>
      <div>
        These metrics are computed for each file.
      </div>

      <h3>Lines</h3>
      <div>
        The number of lines. Should be the equivalent to running the
        standard UNIX tool <span class="file">wc -l</span>. This means
        comments and blank lines are counted.
      </div>

      <div></div>
      <h2>Function metrics</h2>
      <div>
        These metrics are computed for each function, nested function,
        and method.
      </div>

      <h3>Path count</h3>
      <div>
        This approximates the number of paths through a function. This
        metric is based
        on <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/42372.42379">NPATH</a>
        and should be similar what other popular metric tools compute.
      </div>

      <div>
        Note that this number can grow very large, very quickly,
        especially if you have a lot of sequential if blocks. Further
        note that this metric is neither an under-approximate or
        over-approximate, but a reasonable compromise.
      </div>

      <div>
        Since the MATLAB language supports raising and catching
        exceptions (including exceptions further down the call tree) a
        safe over-approximate cannot be reasonably computed since
        every single line may raise multiple exceptions.
