=== Code metric by file:

* Code metrics for file class_file.m:
  file_length: 13 (seems OK)

* Code metrics for file function_file.m:
  file_length: 24 (!not justified!)

  Code metrics for function function_file:
    cnest: 1
    cyc: 4
    function_length: 20
    globals: 0
    npath: 8 (!not justified!)
    parameters: 0
    persistent: 0

* Code metrics for file function_file_justified.m:
  file_length: 24 (for testing purposes)

  Code metrics for function function_file_justified:
    cnest: 1
    cyc: 4
    function_length: 20
    globals: 0
    npath: 8 (for testing purposes)
    parameters: 0
    persistent: 0

* Code metrics for file multi_line.m:
  file_length: 11 (this is a very long justification over many lines)

  Code metrics for function multi_line:
    cnest: 0
    cyc: 1
    globals: 0
    npath: 1
    parameters: 0
    persistent: 0

* Code metrics for file script_file.m:
  file_length: 19 (!not justified!)

  Code metrics for function script_file:
    cnest: 1
    cyc: 4
    globals: 0
    npath: 8 (!not justified!)
    parameters: 0
    persistent: 0

* Code metrics for file script_file_justified.m:
  file_length: 22 (!not justified!)

  Code metrics for function script_file_justified:
    cnest: 1
    cyc: 4
    globals: 0
    npath: 8 (this seems fine)
    parameters: 0
    persistent: 0
